## How to install and run your own local version

As this is a client side application you need very little to host your own version:

- A web server (e.g. apache, nginx)

Expecting more? Not here! 

- Grab a copy of this repository (use Git to clone or download the .zip file) 

- Copy index.html and build/ folder to your chosen web servers root directory

## Developing

First ensure that NodeJS and the node package manager (npm) are installed in your environment

`node --version`

`npm --version`

Clone the repository and change to reattivio directory

`git clone https://github.com/datacenter/reattivio.git`  

`cd reattivio`

Install the required dependencies

`npm install -g gulp`

`npm install`

Launch the development server

`gulp`

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## Building

The default gulp task does not produce production javascript.

To produce a production, minified version, run the following task

`npm run build`
